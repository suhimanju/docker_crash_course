What is Docker Compose?

Multi-container tool to ease administration of 
1. Images
2. Containers
3. Volumes
4. Networks

Default file for docker-compose:
docker-compose.yml

Docker commands spin/kill containers:
docker-compose up -d (runs containers in background)
docker-compose down (kill all containers that were spun using docker-compose file in the previous context)

# Use below command to run docker-compose from a different file name:
docker-compose -f docker-compose-networks.yml up -d

Get docker root folder:
docker info | grep -i root
  Docker Root Dir: /var/lib/docker

Docker Compose yaml mandatory definitions:
version (use version 3 the latest and recommended)
services (should have atleast one service)

Networking in docker compose:

If the containers are spun using docker-compose file, then we can ping the containers using the service names as below:
docker exec nginx sh -c "ping db"

Building an image using docker compose:
docker-compose build 

docker-compose logs -f --> check for logs
